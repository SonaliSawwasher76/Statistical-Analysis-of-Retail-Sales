# Statistical-Analysis-of-Retail-Sales
Statistical analysis of retail sales data using Python, NumPy, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, Chi-Square test, and CLT.


## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive statistical analysis on a large retail (Superstore) dataset to understand sales behavior and customer patterns. The analysis focuses on applying statistical inference techniques rather than machine learning models.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform descriptive statistical analysis using NumPy
- Analyze data distribution and detect outliers
- Demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- Apply hypothesis testing (t-test)
- Perform One-Way ANOVA for multi-group comparison
- Conduct Chi-Square Test of Independence for categorical variables
- Interpret results in a business context

## 🗂 Dataset
- Source: Superstore retail dataset
- Records: 50,000+ transactions
- Key features:
  - Sales
  - Profit
  - Discount
  - Category
  - Segment
  - Region

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Statsmodels

## 📊 Statistical Techniques Used
- Descriptive Statistics
- Outlier Detection (Z-score)
- Central Limit Theorem
- Two-Sample t-Test
- One-Way ANOVA
- Chi-Square Test of Independence

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Sales data is highly right-skewed with significant outliers
- CLT validates the use of parametric tests on sample means
- Product categories differ in average sales
- Customer segment and product category are statistically independent
